Renewable energy sources are those that are naturally replenished on a human timescale. They are derived from natural processes that are continuously replenished. Key examples include solar energy, wind power, hydroelectric power, geothermal energy, and biomass. Unlike fossil fuels, which are finite and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy sources offer a sustainable alternative.

Solar energy harnesses the sun's radiation through technologies like photovoltaic (PV) panels and concentrated solar power (CSP) systems. PV panels convert sunlight directly into electricity, while CSP systems use mirrors to concentrate sunlight to heat a fluid, which then drives a turbine to generate electricity. Solar power is abundant and can be deployed in various scales, from rooftop installations to large solar farms.

Wind power converts wind's kinetic energy into electricity using wind turbines. These turbines typically consist of large blades that rotate when wind passes over them, turning a generator. Wind farms, collections of wind turbines, can be located on land (onshore) or in bodies of water (offshore). Wind energy is a clean fuel source that does not produce air pollution or greenhouse gases.

Hydroelectric power, or hydro power, generates electricity by using the force of moving water. This is typically achieved by building dams on rivers, creating a reservoir. Water released from the reservoir flows through turbines, spinning them to activate a generator. Hydropower is a reliable and well-established renewable energy source, though it can have significant environmental impacts related to dam construction and changes to river ecosystems.

Geothermal energy utilizes heat from within the Earth. Geothermal power plants tap into reservoirs of hot water and steam beneath the Earth's surface to drive turbines. This energy is continuously produced inside the Earth, making it a reliable and constant source of power. Geothermal heat pumps can also be used for heating and cooling buildings directly.
